## Discontinued

The tracker is now no longer updated as I lost interest in Diabotical and it's only taking up storage and CPU time that I'd rather use for different things.

The code used to create this repo can be found here: https://github.com/derrod/dbtracker

# Diabotical Patch Tracker

This repo tracks changes across Diabotical versions.

Some small assets are included for funsies, though the most interesting parts are "scripts" and "ui".
